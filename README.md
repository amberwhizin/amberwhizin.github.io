## Connect 4 Game

A two player game where you drop cylinders into slots starting from the bottom up. The cylinders stack on top of one another as the player works to get 4 in a row before the other player to win the game.


# Technologies

1. Javascript
2. HTML5
3. CSS3

# Approach

First I started mapping out the entire project on google docs. Deciding which day I was going to work on what. Giving myself enough time at teh end to test and polish the app before deployment. Factoring in win/lose logic was going to take the longest. Finally, applying the rest of the CSS3.


# Unsolved

The coin needs to appear when the appropriate slot is clicked on.

# Challenges

The virtical and horizontal wins took me some time to figure out how to do it properly.
