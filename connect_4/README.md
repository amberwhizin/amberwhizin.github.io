### About

My clone of the game Connect 4. I played this a lot as a child with my friends, and we would battle until bedtime! It is a two player game where you drop tokens into slots starting from the bottom up. The tokens stack on top of one another as the player works to get 4 in a row, column, or diagonally - before the other player to wins the game!
