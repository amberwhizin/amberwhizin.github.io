# connect_4

### About

My clone of the game Connect 4. I played this a lot as a child with my friend Erin, we would battle until bedtime! It is a two player game where you drop cylinders into slots starting from the bottom up. The cylinders stack on top of one another as the player works to get 4 in a row, column, or diagonally - before the other player to wins the game!


The technoligies used in my cite are: 
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript and JQuery

### Approach:

- Started by hardcoding basic layout into HTML
- Transfered it to JQuery and JavaScript for flexibility
- Add CSS Styling
- Polish and test my game

### Issues I want to fix:

- reset win text after reseting the board
- tell the user they can click anywhere to play the game again
