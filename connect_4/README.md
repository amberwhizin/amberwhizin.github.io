###About

My clone of the game Connect 4. I played this a lot as a child with my friend Erin, we would battle until bedtime! It is a two player game where you drop cylinders into slots starting from the bottom up. The cylinders stack on top of one another as the player works to get 4 in a row, column, or diagonally - before the other player to wins the game!


The technoligies used in my cite are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery
